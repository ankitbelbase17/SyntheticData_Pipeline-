FINAL RANKING & RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

For E-Commerce Sites (Amazon, eBay, Zalando):
  1st Choice: Method 4 (Requests) - 60% success rate ⭐⭐⭐
  2nd Choice: Method 3 (Selenium Evasion) - 33% success
  3rd Choice: Method 1 (Undetected) - Still testing

For Stock Photo/Restricted Sites (Unsplash, Pixabay):
  1st Choice: Method 1 (Undetected Chrome) - Best for restrictions
  2nd Choice: Method 3 (Selenium) - 0% success on these
  3rd Choice: Method 4 (Requests) - Blocked by HTTP errors

For General Purpose (Balanced):
  🏆 WINNER: METHOD 4 (REQUESTS)
  - Fastest execution
  - Best reliability overall
  - Lightest resource usage
  - Good success rate (50%)
  - Simplest implementation

================================================================================
QUICK DECISION GUIDE
================================================================================

Choose METHOD 4 (REQUESTS) if:
  ✓ You want FASTEST results
  ✓ You're scraping e-commerce sites
  ✓ You want simplest implementation
  ✓ You need low resource usage
  ✓ You don't need JavaScript rendering

Choose METHOD 3 (SELENIUM ADVANCED) if:
  ✓ You want browser automation
  ✓ You need to interact with JavaScript
  ✓ You want to integrate with robust_scraper.py easily
  ✓ You can tolerate some CAPTCHA blocks

Choose METHOD 1 (UNDETECTED CHROME) if:
  ✓ You need BEST bot detection bypass
  ✓ You're willing to wait longer
  ✓ You're scraping sites with CloudFlare/WAF
  ✓ You want specialized anti-detection
  ✓ Success rate is more important than speed

================================================================================
HOW TO USE BEST METHOD IN ROBUST_SCRAPER.PY
================================================================================

OPTION A: Replace with Method 4 (Fastest, Recommended for e-commerce):

Replace this section in robust_scraper.py:
```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.options import Options

driver = webdriver.Chrome(options=chrome_options)
```

With this:
```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

def get_images_with_requests(url):
    headers = {
        'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36'
    }
    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers, timeout=15)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')
        return soup.find_all('img')
    return []
```

OPTION B: Keep Selenium but use Method 3 improvements:

Already compatible! Just modify the setup_driver() function:
- Add user-agent rotation (see test_method_3_selenium_advanced_evasion.py)
- Add random delays between requests
- Add JavaScript injection for stealth
- Remove headless mode for problematic sites

OPTION C: Use Method 1 (Undetected Chrome):

```python
import undetected_chromedriver as uc

# Replace:
# driver = webdriver.Chrome(...)
# With:
driver = uc.Chrome(headless=False)
```

================================================================================
INSTALLATION FOR BEST METHOD (Method 4 - RECOMMENDED)
================================================================================

pip install requests beautifulsoup4

Then integrate the get_images_with_requests() function into robust_scraper.py
